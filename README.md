# Healthcare-prediction-analysis
Project Overview
Healthcare Prediction Analysis is a Machine Learning-based project designed to predict the risk of diseases using patient symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle factors.
The system applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and multiple classification algorithms to build an accurate and reliable prediction model.
This project demonstrates how data analytics and machine learning can support early disease detection and improve healthcare decision-making.
Note: This system is developed for educational and decision-support purposes only. It is not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis.

Objectives
Analyze healthcare-related datasets
Identify key risk factors influencing diseases
Build predictive classification models
Compare multiple algorithms for performance
Provide interpretable and ethical insights

Dataset Description
The dataset includes patient-related features such as:
Symptoms (e.g., chest pain, fatigue, shortness of breath)
Lifestyle factors (smoking, obesity, sedentary lifestyle)
Medical conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol)
Demographic information (age, gender)
Target variable (Disease Risk)

Output
The system predicts disease risk levels such as:
Low Risk
Medium Risk
High Risk
It also identifies the most influential health factors contributing to the prediction.

Ethical Considerations
No personal patient identifiers are used
Dataset is anonymized
Model designed to reduce bias
Transparent feature importance explanation
For academic and research purposes only

Future Enhancements
Web Application using Flask
Dashboard visualization
Integration with real-time healthcare data
Deployment on cloud platforms
